Universalism finds immediate expression in the canon that truth-claims,
whatever their source, are to be subjected to preestablished impersonal
criteria: consonant with observation and with previously confirmed knowl-
edge. The acceptance or rejection of claims entering the lists of science is
not to depend on the personal or social attributes of their protagonist; his
race, nationality, religion, class, and personal qualities are as such irrele-
vant. Objectivity precludes particularism. The circumstance that scientifi-
cally verified formulations refer in that specific sense to objective sequences
and correlations militates against all efforts to impose particularistic criteria
of validity. The Haber process cannot be invalidated by a Nuremberg
decree nor can an Anglophobe repeal the law of gravitation. The chauvinist
may expunge the names of alien scientists from historical textbooks but
their formulations remain indispensable to science and technology. How-
ever echt-deutsch or hundred-percent American the final increment, some
aliens are accessories before the fact of every new scientific advance. The
imperative of universalism is rooted deep in the impersonal character of
science.
